# T5_from_Scratch
T5 - Text To Text Transformer from scratch

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates how to build a T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) model entirely from scratch, without relying on any pre-built libraries such as Hugging Face. The model is implemented using core libraries like TensorFlow, NumPy, and Pandas, offering a deep dive into the mechanics of the T5 architecture.
